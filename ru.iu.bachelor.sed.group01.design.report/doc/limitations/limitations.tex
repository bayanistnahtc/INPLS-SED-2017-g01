\chapter{Known limitations}
\label{chap:know_limitations}


All known and non solved issues (like bugs, missing functionalities, abnormal
behavior, etc.) should be precisely stated and described.


\section{Human factor}
The system has only one Administrator and authorithation for the administrator
mandatory requires the administrator's voice (customer's desire). If the
administrator is sick or somehow lost his voice the login to the system will not
be possible. If a coordinator lost his voice the problem may be solved by
contacting the administrator.

\section{Responsibility of the coordinator}
Responsibility for checking the reliability and consistency of information about
the current situation about the accident belongs to the coordinator of the
crisis. Before sending the report to a recipient coordinator must fully check
the information.

\section{Location of the accident}
One of the main limitation is situation when two or several assidents hapen in
the same time. Some information may be confusing or contradictory, when alerts
appear in the system.
